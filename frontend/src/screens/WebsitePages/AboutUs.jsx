                InvestPuzzle LLC was founded by Ano Glonti in 2022. Ano has
                earned a Bachelor's Degree in Finance from George Mason
                University and a Master's Degree in Global Finance from Fordham
                University. Ano has taken multiple Finance Classes, but she
                particularly distinguishes Student Managed Investment Fund
                (SMIF) at GMU." The first time I had a real stock market
                experience was as a Co-President of the Risk Committee at SMIF.
                Universities provide all the theoretical knowledge we need to
                succeed in the stock market; however, they do not provide enough
                practical tools to make students feel what investing in the
                stock market is like.

              I know many brilliant A-star students who have lost money in the
              stock market because they "did not know what they were doing". Not
              many students can afford to keep investing in the stock market
              after a significant loss. The idea of WaffleStock came to me when
              I took my first big loss in the market; I thought to myself, what
              if there was a place where people could practice investing without
              negative consequences? I wanted to create an environment where
              people can be in the "game we call a stock market" without any
              cost, where they can learn from each other and understand what's
              happening in the market. I wanted this app to be a syrup to SMIF's
              Waffle." – says Ano.
